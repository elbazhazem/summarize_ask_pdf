## 🧠 Project: Summarize & Ask PDF using OpenAI API

### 📌 What does this app do?
This Streamlit app allows users to:
1. Upload any PDF file
2. Read and extract text from it
3. Ask questions or request a summary
4. Get real-time responses from OpenAI's LLM models

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API
- PyPDF2 / pdfplumber
- dotenv

### 🧪 How it works (Summary)
- Load the PDF using PyPDF2
- Display its content in the Streamlit interface
- Let user select a part of the text or ask a question
- Send it to OpenAI ChatCompletion API
- Show the result as summary or answer
